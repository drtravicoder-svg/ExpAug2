- **Hot Reload**: Active (type 'r' in terminal to reload)

## 🧪 **How to Test the App**

### **1. Home Screen Testing**
**What you should see:**
- 🎉 "SQLite Trip Creation App" title
- 📊 Statistics dashboard (showing 0 trips initially)
- 🧳 "Recent Trips" section (empty initially)
- Two buttons: "Create Trip" and "View All Trips"

**Test Actions:**
- Tap "Create Trip" → Should navigate to trip creation form
- Tap "View All Trips" → Should navigate to trips list (empty initially)

### **2. Create Trip Screen Testing**
**Features to test:**
- ✅ Trip name input (required field)
- ✅ Description input (optional, multi-line)
- ✅ Origin and Destination fields
- ✅ Start and End date pickers
- ✅ Currency dropdown (INR, USD, EUR, GBP)
- ✅ Budget amount input
- ✅ Active trip toggle
- ✅ Add members functionality
- ✅ Form validation (try submitting empty form)
- ✅ Save trip button

**Test Scenario:**
1. Fill in trip name: "Test Trip"
2. Add description: "Testing SQLite functionality"
3. Set dates: Start date (today), End date (next week)
4. Select currency: USD
5. Add budget: 1000
6. Add a member: "John Doe" with phone "1234567890"
7. Tap "Save Trip"
8. Should see success message and return to home

### **3. All Trips Screen Testing**
**Features to test:**
- ✅ Search functionality (search bar at top)
- ✅ Filter by status (Planning, Active, Closed, Archived)
- ✅ Trip cards with all information
- ✅ Edit trip functionality
- ✅ Delete trip with undo option
- ✅ Toggle trip status (Active/Planning)
- ✅ Statistics dashboard updates

**Test Scenario:**
1. Create 2-3 trips with different names
2. Use search to find specific trips
3. Toggle trip status (Active/Planning)
4. Try editing a trip
5. Delete a trip and use "Undo" option

### **4. SQLite Database Testing**
**What to verify:**
- ✅ Data persists after app restart
- ✅ Real-time updates across screens
- ✅ Search works across all fields
- ✅ Statistics update automatically
- ✅ Member management works correctly

## 🔧 **Development Tools Available**

### **Hot Reload (Both Platforms)**
```bash
# In the terminal where the app is running, type:
r  # Hot reload (fast, preserves state)
R  # Hot restart (slower, resets state)
q  # Quit the app
```

### **Flutter DevTools**
- **iOS**: http://127.0.0.1:9100?uri=http://127.0.0.1:54371/TkXULAJR9zo=/
- **Android**: http://127.0.0.1:9101?uri=http://127.0.0.1:54478/akX70054XIE=/

**DevTools Features:**
- 🔍 Widget Inspector (UI debugging)
- 📊 Performance Profiler
- 🗄️ Database Inspector
- 📱 Device Simulator Controls
- 🐛 Debugger with breakpoints

### **Database Inspection**
```bash
# To inspect SQLite database directly:
flutter packages pub run sqflite:ffi_debug_database
```

## 🚀 **Next Development Steps**

### **1. Enhanced Features to Add**
```dart
// Expense tracking within trips

// Advanced trip management
- Trip templates
- Recurring trips
- Trip sharing via QR codes
- Offline maps integration

// User experience improvements
- Dark mode support
- Custom themes
- Push notifications
- Biometric authentication
```

### **2. Performance Optimizations**
```dart
// Database optimizations
- Add database indexes
- Implement pagination
- Add caching strategies
- Optimize queries

// UI optimizations
- Add skeleton loading screens
- Implement lazy loading
- Add image caching
- Optimize animations
```

### **3. Production Readiness**
```dart
// Testing
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- Performance tests

// Deployment
- App store optimization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Crash reporting integration
- Analytics implementation
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If App Doesn't Appear on Simulator**
1. Check if simulator is in foreground
2. Look for app icon on home screen
3. Try hot restart (R in terminal)
4. Check terminal for error messages

### **If Database Errors Occur**
1. The SQLite warnings are normal on first run
2. Database will initialize automatically
3. Try creating a trip to test functionality
4. Check DevTools for detailed error info

### **If Hot Reload Doesn't Work**
1. Make sure terminal is active
2. Try hot restart (R) instead
3. Check for compilation errors
4. Restart the app if needed

## 📊 **Performance Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- **App Launch Time**: Should be < 3 seconds
- **Database Operations**: Should be < 100ms
- **UI Responsiveness**: Should maintain 60 FPS
- **Memory Usage**: Should be < 100MB
- **Battery Impact**: Should be minimal

### **Monitoring Tools**
- Flutter DevTools Performance tab
- iOS Instruments (for iOS)
- Android Studio Profiler (for Android)
- Firebase Performance Monitoring (when added)
